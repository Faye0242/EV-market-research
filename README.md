As technologies rapidly innovated and consumers in various market focuses more on green energy, we have heard and seen so many news of electrical vehicles. Not only many famous automobile brands have begun to invest in the development and sale of electric vehicles, but also many emerging brands specializing in the sale of EV have attracted consumers' attention in the automobile market.

The rapid development of EV market triggers by different factors, including government policy support and consumption habits of different users in different countries and consumption levels. In this project, I used tableau to visualize and rank the current EV market share in worldwide and talked about causual inference between the policy support and increase of market share. What's more, I create user profiles for consumers in countries with significant EV consumption and discuss effective EV development strategies and growth forecasts.
